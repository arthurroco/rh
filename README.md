# Turning Data Into Insights

## Introduction 
The dataset (Excel file or Tableau files or .sql files) in database folder revolves around a company called Acme Corporation which contains names, date of birth, gender, background education, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, and satisfaction score.
We've included some open-ended questions that you can explore and try to address through creating Power BI visualizations, like:
- Is there any relationship between which department a person works for their satisfaction score?
- What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
- What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
- Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?

**Good luck and enjoy the learning!**

## Prerequisites

## About the Challenge
### Scope
The director of the human resources area wants to have visibility on the company's workforce. For this, he wants a dashboard that brings general numbers such as the number of active employees. This number, he/she wants to see by:
- Department
- Salary range
- Satisfaction rating/grade
- Hiring date

In addition to the overall point of view, he/she wants to view these same numbers by:
- Gender
- Ethnicity 
- Background education

These numbers should answer:
- Is there any difference in salary between genders?
- Is there a salary difference between races?
- Are there any areas where employees are unhappy?
- Do we have diversity? If so, what is the most diverse department, source of hiring that encourages this and how can we improve. The director suggested that the BI area look at market indicators and adapt them to our dashboard, such as: Richness, Evenness, and Simpson's Diversity Index.

### Data description
ACME has its own HCM system. The filling of information is done by human resources analysts, but the system is not yet mature enough to validate formatting, for example.
Despite having a multi-dimensional modeling, our HCM developer brought the data in a single file without any kind of treatment. However, in this file there is all the data necessary to be able to create the dashboard as requested by the human resources director. Maybe yes, maybe not, you can find other files which can help you.

## Next Releases
    Not necessarily in this order:

1. I wanna share some dashboards as samples using the most used BI IDE such as Tableau, PowerBI, and Qlik.
2. In a near future, I wanna share these dataset on AWS Cloud envirorment in Redshift and AWS RDS.
3. I am going to evaluate rating grade for Scients can be anwser which employee could leave the company.
