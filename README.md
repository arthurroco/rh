## About the challenge

1. How many departments are there?
2. How many headcount are in which department?
3. How is the distributions between males and females?
4. She knows there was an internal survey asking about satisfaction and other important questions. Is there any possibility of knowing before the announcement if any employee will ask to be fired?
5. Is there any way to identify about gender identity? If yes, is it possible to show how works the distribution across the company?
6. Is there some department promoting prejudice, sexism and/or racism?
7. Are there other ways to show how we can improve and promote diversity? Are there global KPI which could be used?
